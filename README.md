# Census-Data

**Overview:**

The United States Census Bureau (USCB), officially the Bureau of the Census, is a principal agency 
of the U.S. Federal Statistical System, responsible for producing data about the American people and 
economy. The Census Bureau's primary mission is conducting the U.S. Census every ten years, which 
allocates the seats of the U.S. House of Representatives to the states based on their population. The 
Bureau's various censuses and surveys help allocate over $675 billion in federal funds every year and 
it helps states, local communities, and businesses make informed decisions. The information provided 
by the census informs decisions on where to build and maintain schools, hospitals, transportation 
infrastructure, and police and fire departments.
